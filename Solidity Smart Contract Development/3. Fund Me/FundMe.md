# Fund Me

## Introduction
- In this section, we'll create a _decentralized crowdfunding_ contract

- For this project, we will be using two contracts: `FundMe`, the main crowdfunding contract, and `PriceConverter`. They function much like _Kickstarter_, allowing users to **send** any native blockchain cryptocurrency. They also enable the owner of the contract to **withdraw** all the funds collected. We will then deploy these contracts on a **testnet**.

> 🗒️ **NOTE**\
> Use testnet sparingly. Limiting testnet transactions helps prevent network congestion, ensuring a smoother testing experience for everyone.

## fund and withdraw
- Once `FundMe` is deployed on Remix, you'll notice a set of _functions_, including a new red button labelled `fund`, indicating that the function is _payable_. A payable function allows you to send native blockchain currency (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche) to the contract.

- We'll additionally indicate a **minimum USD amount** to send to the contract when the function `fund` is called. To transfer funds to the `FundMe` contract, you can navigate to the _value section_ of the Remix deployment tab, enter a value (e.g. 0.1 ether) then hit `fund`. A MetaMask transaction confirmation will appear, and the contract balance will remain zero until the transaction is finalized. Once completed, the contract balance will be updated to reflect the transferred amount.

- The contract owner can then `withdraw` the funds. In this case, since we own the contract, the balance will be removed from the contract's balance and transferred to our wallet.

## Conclusion
- These 25 lessons will guide you step-by-step through the implementation of a crowdfunding contract, that supports cryptocurrency contributions and owner withdrawals.

# Project Setup
- Let's begin by coding `FundMe`, a crowdfunding contract allowing users to send funds, which the owner can later withdraw. Before we start, let's clean up our Remix IDE workspace

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT**\
> Before you start coding, try to write down in plain English what you want your code to achieve. This helps clarify your goals and structure your approach.

We want `FundMe` to perform the following tasks:

1. **Allow users to send funds into the contract:** users should be able to deposit funds into the 'FundMe' contract
2. **Enable withdrawal of funds by the contract owner:** the account that owns `FundMe` should have the ability to withdraw all deposited funds
3. **Set a minimum funding value in USD:** there should be a minimum amount that can be deposited into the contract

## fund and withdraw functions
- The FundMe contract will have two primary functions that serve as the main interaction points:

1. **`fund`:** allows users to deposit funds into the contract
2. **`withdraw`:** grants the contract owner the ability to withdraw the funds that have been previously deposited

First, let's code the `fund` function and leave the `withdraw` function commented out for the moment.

```solidity
contract FundMe {
    // send funds into our contract
    function fund() public {}
    // owner can withdraw funds
    /*function withdraw() public {}*/
}
```

# Sending Eth through a function
- In this part, we'll explore how to transfer Ethereum (ETH) to a smart contract by creating a `fund` function. This function will require a _minimum amount of ETH_ to ensure proper transaction handling.

## Value and Payable
- When a transaction it's sent to the blockchain, a **value** field is always included in the _transaction data_. This field indicates the **amount** of the native cryptocurrency being transferred in that particular transaction.
For the function `fund` to be able to receive Ethereum, it must be declared **`payable`**. In the Remix UI, this keyword will turn the function red, signifying that it can accept cryptocurrency.

- _Wallet addresses_ and _smart contracts_ are capable of **holding** and **managing** cryptocurrency funds. These entities can interact with the funds, perform transactions, and maintain balance records, just like a wallet.

```solidity
function fund() public payable {
    // allow users to send $
    // have a minimum of $ sent
    // How do we send ETH to this contract?
    msg.value;

    //function withdraw() public {}
}
```

- In Solidity, the **value** of a transaction is accessible through the [`msg.value`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/units-and-global-variables.html#special-variables-and-functions) **property**. This property is part of the _global object_ `msg`. It represents the amount of **Wei** transferred in the current transaction, where _Wei_ is the smallest unit of Ether (ETH).

## Reverting transactions
- We can use the`require` keyword as a checker, to enforce our function to receive a minimum `value` of one (1) whole ether:

```solidity
require(msg.value > 1e18); // 1e18 = 1 ETH = 1 * 10 ** 18
```

- This `require` condition ensures that the transaction meets the minimum ether requirements, allowing the function to execute only if this threshold is satisfied. If the specified requirement is not met, the transaction will **revert**

- The require statement in Solidity can include a custom error message, which is displayed if the condition isn't met, clearly explaining the cause of the transaction failure:

```js
require(msg.value > 1 ether, "Didn't send enough ETH"); //if the condition is false, revert with the error message
```

- An online tool like [Ethconverter](https://eth-converter.com/) can be useful for executing conversions between _Ether_, _Wei_, and _Gwei_

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT**\
> 1 Ether = 1e9 Gwei = 1e18 Wei

> 🗒️ **NOTE**\
> Gas costs are usually expressed in Gwei

- If a user attempts to send less Ether than the required amount, the transaction will **fail** and a _message_ will be displayed. For example, if a user attempts to send 1000 Wei, which is significantly less than one Ether, the function will revert and does not proceed.

## Conclusion

- In this lesson, we explored how to use the `value` field of a transaction to transfer Ether to a contract. We also learned how to generate an **error message** when the user sends insufficient Ether to the `FundMe` contract
