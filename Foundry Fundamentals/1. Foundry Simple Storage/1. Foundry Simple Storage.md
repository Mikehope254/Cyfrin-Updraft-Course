# Foundry Fundamentals

Welcome to Foundry 101. Throughout this course, you will acquire the skills you’ll need to start developing your smart contracts and protocols using the best web3 development tools and frameworks like Chainlink, Alchemy, and Foundry.

### What is Foundry?

Foundry is a relatively new but rapidly growing smart contract development framework known for its efficiency and modularity. The best short description of this powerful tool can be found in the [Foundry Book:](https://getfoundry.sh/)

```
Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.

```

Please take a moment to bookmark the [Foundry Book:](https://getfoundry.sh/). It is the most comprehensive resource that has the answers to all your questions. It will be handy along the way.

Foundry has numerous pros, such as:

- It leverages Rust for compilation, offering significantly faster build times compared to frameworks like Hardhat or Brownie.

- It's entirely Solidity-based, eliminating the need to learn other programming languages

- Its documentation is comprehensive.

### Our favorite code editor: Visual Studio Code

Throughout this course, we will use Visual Studio Code to write, test, deploy and interact with our smart contracts. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, powerful source code editor available on Windows, macOS and Linux. It has a comprehensive ecosystem of extensions that makes it one of the best choices when it comes to smart contract development.

### Keeping your Terminal Clutter-free

When commands pile up in your terminal, things can get a little overwhelming. Clear it up by simply typing `clear` and hitting `Enter`. Alternatively, use `Command K` if you're on a Mac or `Control K` if you're on Linux or Windows.

Pro tip: This is one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts that I use all the time.

### Understanding the Trash Can and the X

The trash can and the X buttons in your terminal perform distinct functions. Hitting X simply hides your terminal but retains all the previous lines of code. On the other hand, trashing it essentially deletes whatever is running in it. To open up a clean terminal, hit the trash can and then pull it back using `Control+`` or `Terminal > New Terminal`.

### Installing Foundry

With our terminal set and some tips up our sleeve, let's progress to installing Foundry. Navigate to the [Foundry website](https://getfoundry.sh/introduction/installation/) and from the installation tab, fetch the command to install Foundry.

The command would look something like this:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Hit `Enter` after pasting this in your terminal.

Note: You must have Internet access for this to work as it's downloading Foundry from their official website.

### Verifying Your Installation
After running the `curl` command, an output will appear at the bottom of your terminal indicating the detected shell and the fact that Foundry has been added to your Path.

For instance, the output can be something like this:

```bash
Detected your preferred shell is bashrc and added Foundry to Path run:source /home/user/.bashrcStart
a new terminal session to use Foundry
```

Now, simply type `foundryup` and `Enter` to install and update Foundry to the latest version. Whenever you want to install an update for Foundry, simply run `foundryup` again.

This will install four components: forge, cast, anvil, and chisel. To confirm the successful installation, run `forge --version`. You should get an output indicating the Forge version as shown below.

```bash
Forge version x.x.x
```

### Is Foundry Up Not Running?
Don't panic if this command doesn't run. You might have an issue with your path, and you might need to add Foundry to your path. In case you run into this issue, check lesson 6 of the GitHub repo associated with this course. If no debugging tips are available there, feel free to start a discussion on the course's GitHub repo. Before doing so, make sure to check if a similar discussion already exists.

Try typing `forge --version` into your terminal. Have you received an unwelcome output saying `Forge command found?` This implies that you have to rerun the `source` command that Foundry offered during installation.

Note: Most of the time the `bashrc` file gets loaded automatically. However, if this doesn't apply to your setup, the following lines can add the required command to the end of your `Bash profile`. This will ensure that your `bashrc` file loads by default.

```bash
cd ~
echo 'source /home/user/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

> this depends on your operating system, please check foundry docs to see detailed instructions.

# Create a new Foundry Project
Reminder: We ran the following commands

```bash
mkdir foundry-f23
cd foundry-f23
```

Now type the following commands:

```bash
mkdir foundry-simple-storage-f23
cd foundry-simple-storage-f23
```

You can always make the cd command faster by pressing the Tab key after you type the first couple of letters from the destination name. Tab lets you autocomplete a lot of commands/paths.

If you type `code .` a new instance of VS Code will open, having the foundry-simple-storage-f23 as the default path.

You can see the contents of this folder on the left sidebar. Try the following command:

```bash
touch randomFile.txt
```

This will create a randomFile.txt

If you want to delete it type:

```bash
rm randomFile.txt
```

The terminal is pretty slick when it comes to moving/opening/creating directories/files, changing paths and generally running things. I recommend going through [this tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) if you want to learn how to move extra fast.

### Creating a New Project
The way you [create a new Foundry project](https://getfoundry.sh/guides/project-setup/creating-a-new-project/) is by running the `forge init` command. This will create a new Foundry project in your current working directory.

If you want Foundry to create the new project in a new folder type `forge init nameOfNewFolder`.

Keep in mind that by default `forge init` expects an empty folder. If your folder is not empty you must run `forge init --force`.

Be sure to configure your username and email if you encounter errors related to Git configuration.

```bash
git config --global user.email "yourEmail@provider.com"
git config --global user.name "yourUsername"
```

And that's it, your folder should look as follows:

![Foundry1](../Images/foundry1.png)

But what does all this mean?

`lib` is the folder where all your dependencies are installed, here you'll find things like:

- `forge-std` (the forge library used for testing and scripting)

- `openzeppelin-contracts` is the most battle-tested library of smart contracts

- and many more, depending on what you need/install

`scripts` is a folder that houses all your scripts

`src` is the folder where you put all your smart contracts

`test` is the folder that houses all your tests

`foundry.toml` - gives configuration parameters for Foundry

More on these folders and files later.

Please right-click `src`, click on `New File` and name it `SimpleStorage.sol`. Copy the code available [here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-simple-storage-cu/blob/main/src/SimpleStorage.sol).

One last thing, please delete `Counter.s.sol`, `Counter.sol` and `Counter.t.sol`. These files are a set of basic smart contracts that Foundry provides as a default when you create a new Foundry project.

# Foundry Setup (Windows/WSL)

### WSL setup
Microsoft has significantly improved its development environment support in recent years. However, for _smart contract development_, installing dependencies can sometimes be tricky. To streamline this process, we will use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): this is a better option because it enables a full-fledged unix-like console on your Windows machine, simplifying the use of tools and utilities commonly found in _unix-based environments_. This setup ensures compatibility with all the code that runs on unix-based systems like macOS and Linux.

To install WSL, you can begin by opening the Windows terminal. On Windows 11, press the Windows key, type "terminal," and hit enter. On Windows 10, you need to install the Windows terminal from the Microsoft Store (select the official app from Microsoft Corporation).

Once installed, open the terminal and type `wsl --install`. This command will initiate the installation process. Afterward, restart your computer. Upon reboot, the terminal will appear again, prompting you to select a Unix username and set a password. WSL will be then successfully installed ✅.

Visual Studio Code
After installing WSL, we need to install a code editor. We will use Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and there are three different methods to install it:

1. Using the Terminal: Utilize `winget`, a package manager pre-installed on Windows 11. Open the terminal and type winget search VS Code to find the desired package. Then, execute `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode` to install VS Code.

2. Via Web Browser: Search for "Visual Studio Code" in your web browser, select the official Microsoft link and download the installer. Follow the prompts, accept the user agreement and customize all the installation options.

3. Using VSCodium: For those who prefer more independence and privacy, there is an open-source alternative called VSCodium. It is similar to VS Code but without Microsoft's telemetry. Download the [VSCodium installer](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases) from GitHub and follow its similar installation steps.

Choose the method that best suits your needs. For this course, I will use the official Visual Studio Code from Microsoft.

# VSCode Solidity setup

### Improving Code Format in Visual Studio Code
When you first start, your code might just look like a whole bunch of dull, lifeless, white text.

This can be easily fixed by using one of the `Solidity` extensions. Out of all the Solidity extensions available in the Extensions tab (CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + X) the following are worth mentioning:

1. Solidity by Juan Blanco, the most used Solidity extension out there.

2. Solidity by Nomic Foundation is Patrick's favorite Solidity extension. The rest of the course will be displaying this extension.

3. Solidity Visual Developer is another popular choice.

NOTE: If the code remains unhighlighted despite having installed the extension, there's a quick solution to that. `Press Command + Shift + P` or `Control + Shift + P` on Windows. This opens up the command bar. In the command bar, type in "Settings" and select "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)".

If you have nothing in there, create a new setting by typing in:

```solidity
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "NomicFoundation.hardhat"
}
```

Use:

`"editor.defaultFormatter": "tintinweb.solidity-visual-auditor"` for Solidity Visual Developer

or

`"editor.defaultFormatter": "JuanBlanco.solidity"` for Solidity by Juan Blanco

### Other interesting extensions
In the previous lesson, we mentioned a file called `foundry.toml`. This also has an extension that formats it to make it easier to read. Please install [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml).

Another indispensable extension is [Inline Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.vscode-inline-bookmarks).

The Inline Bookmarks plugin facilitates bookmarking the actual code. The extension can be used for document review, auditing, log analysis, and keeping track of development notes and to-do lists. You may share your notes and bookmarks with others with ease because they are saved with your files.

The following default trigger words/tags are configured by default:

```solidity
@todo - (blue) General ToDo remark.
@note - (blue) General remark.
@remind - (blue) General remark.
@follow-up - (blue) General remark.
@audit - (red) General bookmark for potential issues.
@audit-info - (blue) General bookmark for information to be noted for later use.
@audit-ok - (green) Add a note that a specific line is not an issue even though it might look like.
@audit-issue - (purple) Reference a code location an issue was filed for.
```

You can fully customize the colors!

Remember these! They will be very handy in developing and especially in auditing projects.

More details are available [here](https://github.com/tintinweb/vscode-inline-bookmarks).

Next comes the fun part! Let's compile our contract using Foundry!

# Compile a smart contract using Foundry

Open a new terminal. Type in `forge build` or `forge compile` to compile the smart contracts in your project.

Once the compiling is finished, you'll see some new folders in the Explorer tab on the left side. One of them is a folder called out. Here you'll be able to find the [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html) of the smart contract together with the [Bytecode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solidity/introduction-to-bytecode-and-opcode-in-solidity/) and a lot of useful information.

The cache folder also appears. Generally, this folder is used to store temporary system files facilitating the compilation process. But for this course, you can safely ignore it.

### More terminal wizardry
Throughout your solidity development/audit journey you will type a lot of terminal commands, every time to make a change that you want tested you'll probably have to rerun the `forge build` then maybe you test it with `forge test` or run a script with `forge script` and many more. Typing all these over and over again is inefficient and time-consuming. The better way is to use the `up` and `down` arrow keys. The up and down arrow keys to cycle through the recent commands.

Ok, cool! We learned how to compile a contract, but how does one deploy a smart contract?

# Deploying a smart contract Locally using Anvil

There are multiple ways and multiple places where you could deploy a smart contract.

While developing using the Foundry framework the easiest and most readily available place for deployment is Anvil.

Anvil is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC.

To run Anvil you simply have to type `anvil` in the terminal.

![anvil](../Images/anvil.png)

You now have access to 10 test addresses funded with 10_000 ETH each, with their associated private keys.

This testnet node always listens on `127.0.0.1:8545` this will be our `RPC_URL` parameter when we deploy smart contracts here. More on this later!

More info about Anvil is available [here](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview#anvil).

Please press `Ctrl/CMD + C` to close Anvil.

Anvil will be used throughout the course to deploy and test our smart contracts, but before that, let's quickly check an intermediary step.

## Configuring MetaMask

To deploy to a custom network (like your localhost), you'll need MetaMask. MetaMask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.

Follow these steps:

   1. Open MetaMask.

   2. Click the three little dots and select 'Expand View'.

   3. Go to 'Settings', then 'Networks'.

   4. Here, you'll see the list of networks (Ethereum, Mainnet, etc.) with plenty of details about each one. Locate the RPC URL - this is key.

The RPC URL is essentially the endpoint we make API calls to when sending transactions. For every blockchain transaction you execute, you're making an API to whatever is in here.
To send a transaction to your custom blockchain, you need to add it as a network:

   1. Click on 'Add a Network'

   2. Scroll to the bottom of the list of networks.

   3. Hit 'Add a Network manually'.

   4. Enter the details of your local network

   - Network name: Localhost

   - New RPC URL: Ganachehttp://127.0.0.1:7545 or Anvil http://127.0.0.1:8545 (make sure you always add http://) - these two could differ on your machine, please consult the Ganache UI or Anvil terminal for the exact RPC URL.

   - Chain ID: Ganache 5777(sometimes 1337) or Anvil 31337 - these two could differ on your machine, please consult the Ganache UI or Anvil terminal for the exact Chain ID.

   - Currency symbol: ETH

   - Block explorer URL: - (we don't have a block explorer for our newly created blockchain, which will most likely disappear when we close the VS Code / Ganache app)

Great! Now that we configured our local network, the next step is to add one of the accounts available in Ganache or Anvil into our MetaMask. This is done as follows:

   1. Click the account selector at the top of your wallet.

   2. Click Add account or hardware wallet.

   3. Click Import account

   4. You will be directed to the Import page. Paste your Ganache/Anvil private key. Click Import.

**NOTE: Do not use this account for anything else, do not interact with it or send things to it on mainnet or any other real blockchain, use it locally, for testing purposes. Everyone has access to it.**

Next up we shall talk more about adding a new network to MetaMask.

## Adding New Networks Using MetaMask

Conveniently, MetaMask provides an easy way to add EVM-compatible chains. By pre-configuring a host of them, you can add a chain such as the Arbitrum One by simply clicking on the `Networks` button on the top left, then `Add Network` and proceeding to `Add`. The pleasing part is that MetaMask does all the grunt work, filling in all the necessary information for you. A click on Approve Network ensures the successful addition of the network.

Steps:

   1. Click on the Networks button on the top left

   2. Click on Add Network

   3. Choose your desired EVM-compatible chain

   4. Click on Add

   5. After ensuring all necessary information is already filled in, click on Approve Network

But what can you do if the chain you want to add is not pre-configured?

Simple! You employ the same process we just used to add our new Anvil local chain in the previous lesson

# Deploy a smart contract locally using forge

To find out more about forge's capabilities type

```solidity
forge --help
```

Out of the resulting list, we are going to use the `create` command.

Type `forge create --help` in the terminal or go [here](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/forge-create/) to find out more about the available configuration options.

Try running `forge create SimpleStorage`. It should fail because we haven't specified a couple of required parameters:

   1. `Where do we deploy?`

   2. `Who's paying the gas fees/signing the transaction?`

Let's tackle both these questions.

As you've learned in the previous lessons, each blockchain (private or public) has an RPC URL (RPC SERVER) that acts as an endpoint. When we tried to deploy our smart contract, forge tried to use `http://localhost:8545/`, which doesn't host any blockchain. Thus, let's try to deploy our smart contract specifying the place where we want to deploy it.

Please start Ganache and press Quickstart Ethereum. Copy the RPC Server HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545. Let's run our forge create again specifying the correct rpc url.

```solidity
forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:7545
```

This again failed, indicating the following:
```
Error accessing local wallet. Did you set a private key, mnemonic or keystore?
```

Try the following command:

```
forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:7545 --interactive
```
You will be asked to enter a private key, please paste one of the private keys available in Anvil. When you paste a key you won't see the text or any placeholder symbols, just press CTRL(CMD) + V and then ENTER.

> for **clearer** output try:

> ```
> forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:7545 --interactive --broadcast
> ```

Voila!

![forge-create](../Images/forge-create.png)

From now on, everything we deploy shall be done on Anvil. But if you like Ganache more, feel free to use that.

Do the following:

   1. Run `clear`

   2. Run `anvil`

   3. Create a new terminal by pressing the + button

   4. Copy one of the private keys from the anvil terminal

   5. Run forge create SimpleStorage --interactive --broadcast
    We don't need to specify an --rpc-url this time because forge defaults to Anvil's RPC URL.

   6. Go to the Anvil terminal and check the deployment details:

```solidity
    Transaction: 0x40d2ca8f0d680f098c7d5e3c127ef1ce1207ef439ba6e163c2042483e15998a6
    Contract created: 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3
    Gas used: 357076
​
    Block Number: 1
    Block Hash: 0x85a56c0b8f166e86d1cce65412615e0d9a72972e04b2488023275131ea27330a
    Block Time: "Mon, 15 Apr 2024 11:50:55 +0000"
​```

The more explicit way to deploy using forge create is as follows:

``` solidity
forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 --broadcast
```

We included the --rpc-url to not count on the default and the --private-key to not use the --interactive option anymore.

>> --broadcast option displays output more clearly compared in later forge versions

Pfew! That was a lot, but we learned a very important thing, how to deploy a smart contract on two local blockchains. But what comes next is one of the most important if not the MOST IMPORTANT aspects you will learn here: _Private key safety_.

***

# Practicing Private Key Safety

Having a private key in plain text is extremely bad. The private key(s) we used in the last lesson are well-known keys for local testing, you shouldn't use those on mainnet and keeping them in plain text is ok, but any other private key should be kept hidden, especially your production key or key's associated with accounts that hold crypto.

Moreover, it's very bad to have private keys in bash history (hit the up arrow and see the key you used to deploy).

You can delete your history by typing:

```bash
history -c
```

We will teach you more about how to secure private keys in one of the next lessons.

## Your Safety Promise

It's time now to articulate your promise for maintaining private key safety. Create a file titled Promise.md. In this file, make it a point to write down your promise:

```markdown
I promise to never use my private key associated with real money in plain text.
```

Hacking private keys is one of the most important reasons people and projects lose absurd amounts. You don't even need to look that deep to find titles like this:

[The Ronin hack](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-ronin-hack-march-2022) - Social engineering of private keys

[Early Crypto Investor Bo Shen Says He Lost $42 Million in Wallet Hack](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/early-crypto-investor-bo-shen-says-he-lost-42-million-in-wallet-hack-1.1850446)

[The $477 million FTX hack](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-477-million-ftx-hack-following-the-blockchain-trail) where `The new CEO of FTX revealed that private keys allowing access to the firm’s crypto assets were stored in unencrypted form, and a former employee disclosed that over $150 million was stolen from Alameda Research, due to poor security.`

Don't be like that! Maybe you are not holding millions, but what you hold is yours, don't let it become theirs!

In the following lessons, we'll learn how to access RPC URLs for free using Alchemy for any blockchain. We will also delve into exploring safer methodologies for dealing with private keys. Stay tuned!


# Deploy a smart contract locally using Anvil via scripts

Deploying a smart contract via scripting is particularly handy because it provides a consistent and repeatable way to deploy reliably and its features enhance the testing of both the deployment processes and the code itself.

There's a strong chance that you like the command-line approach, but scripting enriches the whole deployment process, bringing in more functionality and an ease of use second to none.

Foundry eases the whole process since it is written in Solidity. This means our deployment scripts will also be written in Solidity. It is essential to distinguish Solidity as a contract language from Solidity as a scripting language. Foundry also incorporates elements that enhance our Solidity experience beyond the smart contracts realm. So, let's get started on creating a script to deploy our simple storage contract.

In Foundry we keep our scripts in the script folder.

Please create a new file called `DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol`.

Using `.s.sol` as a suffix is a naming convention for Foundry scripts, in future lessons, when we'll write Foundry tests, these will bear the suffix of `.t.sol`.

For more best practice info regarding Foundry scripts please click [here](https://getfoundry.sh/guides/best-practices/writing-contracts/#scripts).

Open the newly created file. Here we'll write a solidity script for deploying our SimpleStorage contract.

Type the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
​
pragma solidity 0.8.19;
​
contract DeploySimpleStorage {
    
}
```

The first two lines are pretty self-explanatory.

We declare the new contract, named `DeploySimpleStorage`

For it to be considered a Foundry script and to be able to access the extended functionality Foundry is bringing to the table we need to import Script from `"forge-std/Script.sol"` and make `DeploySimpleStorage` inherit Script.

NOTE: `forge-std` also called Forge Standard Library is a collection of pre-written Solidity contracts designed to simplify and enhance scripting and testing within the Foundry development framework.

Furthermore, to be able to deploy `SimpleStorage` we also need to import it by typing `import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
​
pragma solidity 0.8.19;
​
import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";
​
contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
    
}
```

Every script needs a main function, which, according to the best practice linked above is called `run`. Whenever you run `forge script` this is the function that gets called.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
​
pragma solidity 0.8.19;
​
import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";
​
contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
    function run() external returns (SimpleStorage) {
        vm.startBroadcast();
​
        SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
​
        vm.stopBroadcast();
        return simpleStorage;
    }
}
```

`run` is an external function that will return the `SimpleStorage` contract.

In the Run function, we are going to use a distinctive keyword: `vm`. Foundry has a distinctive feature known as cheat codes. The `vm` keyword is a cheat code in Foundry, and thereby only works in Foundry.

`vm.startBroadcast` indicates the starting point for the list of transactions that get to be sent to the RPC URL;

Similarly, `vm.stopBroadcast` indicates the ending point of the list of transactions that get to be sent to the `RPC URL;`

Between those two we write:

`SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();`

The `new` keyword is used to create a new smart contract in Solidity.

We end the function with `return simpleStorage;`.

Please select the `Anvil` terminal and press `CTRL(CMD) + C` to stop it. Now run the following command:

```bash
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol
```

This should go through without any errors, but if you hit some errors related to `incompatible solidity versions in various files` please ensure that both the `SimpleStorage.sol` and `DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol` use `pragma solidity 0.8.19;`

If you want to further extend your knowledge about scripting please go [here](https://getfoundry.sh/guides/scripting-with-solidity/)

You should get the following output:

```solidity
[⠆] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 2 files with 0.8.19
[⠒] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 1.08s
Compiler run successful!

​
If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

**The million-dollar question**: If we didn't pass an RPC URL, where did this deploy to?

If the RPC URL is not specified, Foundry automatically launches an Anvil instance, runs your script (in our case deployed the contract) and then terminates the Anvil instance.

Run the `anvil` command in the terminal, open up a new terminal and type the following:

```bash
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

To get the following output:

```text

​
==========================
​
SIMULATION COMPLETE. To broadcast these transactions, add --broadcast and wallet configuration(s) to the previous
command. See forge script --help for more.
```

**Another million-dollar question**: Is it deployed now?

Answer: No, the output indicates this was a simulation. But, we got a new folder out of this, the `broadcast` folder contains information about different script runs in case we forget details.

Hit the up arrow key and add `--interactive --broadcast --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` at the end.

Our contract is now successfully deployed! Fantastic!

Switch to the `anvil` terminal where you'll see:

```text
    Transaction: 0x73eb9fb4ef7b159e03c50d669c42e2ec4eeaa9358bea0a710cb07168e5192570

```

Awesome!

Through this lesson we kept talking about a thing called `transaction`, but what is a `transaction`? Tune in the next lesson to find out.

# What is a Transaction?

## More about blockchain transactions

In the previous lesson we kept talking about transactions, but we never explained what a transaction is. In simple terms, a transaction captures details of an activity that has taken place on a blockchain.

On the left side of your screen, in the Explorer tab, you'll find a folder called `broadcast`. Foundry saves all your blockchain interactions here. The `dry-run` folder is used for interactions you made when you didn't have a blockchain running (remember that time when we deployed our contract without specifying an `--rpc-url`). Moreover, the recordings here are separated by chainId.

Note: The `chainId` is a unique identifier assigned to a specific blockchain network. It is used to distinguish one blockchain from another and is a crucial parameter for ensuring the security and integrity of transactions and interactions on the blockchain.

Click on `run-latest.json`.
Here we can find more details about the last deployment script we ran in our previous lesson. It will show things like `transactionType`, `contractName` and `contractAddress`. Moreover, in the `transaction` section, you can see what we actually sent over to the RPC URL:

```javascript
      "transaction": {
        "from": "0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266",
        "to": null,
        "gas": "0x714e1",
        "value": "0x0",
        "input": "0x608060...c63430008130033",
        "nonce": "0x0",
        "chainId": "0x7a69",
        "accessList": null,
        "type": null
      }
```

Let's go through each of these:

   - `from` is self-explanatory, it's the address we used to sign the transaction;

   - `to` is the recipient, in our case is null or address(0), this is the standard destination for when new smart contracts are deployed;

   - `gas` is the amount of gas spent. You will see the hex value `0x714e1` (or any other value represented in hex format);

**Quick tip**: Normal humans can't understand hex values like the one indicated above, but there's a quick way to convert these into usual numbers. Run the following command in your terminal: `cast --to-base 0x714e1 dec`. `cast` is a very versatile tool provided by Foundry, type `cast --help` in your terminal to find out more, or go [here](https://getfoundry.sh/releases#cast-features).

   - `value` is the transaction value, or the amount of ETH we are sending over. Given that this transaction was made to deploy a contract, the value here is 0x0 or 0, but we could have specified a value and that would have been the initial balance of the newly deployed contract;

   - `data` in this case is the contract deployment code and the contract code. In the excerpt above this was truncated;

   - `nonce` is a unique identifier assigned to each transaction sent from a specific account. The `nonce` is used to ensure that each transaction is processed only once and to prevent replay attacks. nonce is incremented with every single transaction;

   - `accessList` is a feature of Ethereum to optimize the gas cost of transactions. It contains a list of addresses and associated storage keys that the transaction is likely to access, allowing the EVM to more efficiently compute the gas cost of storage access during the transaction's execution;

   - `type` please ignore this for now.

There are other values that play an important part that weren't presented in that list, namely the `v`, `r`, and `s`. These are components of a transaction's signature, which are used to validate the authenticity and integrity of the transaction.

Whenever we send a transaction over the blockchain there's a signature happening, that's where we use our `private key`.

Important: Every time you change the state of the blockchain you do it using a transaction. The thing that indicates the change is the data field of a transaction. Deployment bytecode, contract bytecode and OPCODEs will be tackled in a future lesson.

# Important Private Key Safety pt.2

## How to not have your private key in the command line

Some lessons ago we deployed SimpleStorage using the following command:

```solidity
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

Having our private key in plain text is very bad, as we've explained in [Lesson 13](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/foundry-simple-storage/private-key-safety). What can we do to avoid this, except using the `--interactive` parameter, because we don't want to keep copy-pasting our private key?

**BIG BOLDED DISCLAIMER: What we are about to do is fine for development purposes, do not put a real key here, it very terrible for production purposes.**

Create a new file in the root of your project called `.env`. Then, go the `.gitignore` file and make sure `.env` is in there.

The `.env` file will host environment variables. Variables that are of a sensitive nature that we don't want to expose in public.

Open the file and put the following in it:

```solidity
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

Next run `source .env`. This adds the above-mentioned environment variables into our shell. Now run `echo $PRIVATE_KEY` or `echo $RPC_URL` to check if the values are stored in the shell.

Now we can safely replace the parameters in our `forge script` command:

```solidity
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

This doesn't only hide your private key from plain sight in the command line but also facilitates faster terminal usage, imagine you'd have to copy-paste the `http://127.0.0.1:8545` RPC URL over and over again. It's cleaner this way.

But yes, now we have the private key in plain text in the `.env` file, that's not good.

## How to handle this problem with production code?

Foundry has a very nice option called `keystore`. To read more about it type `forge script --help` in your terminal. Using `forge script --keystore <PATH>` allows you to specify a path to an encrypted store file, encrypted by a password. Thus your private key would never be available in plain text.

Let's agree to the following:

  - For testing purposes use a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in an `.env` file as long as you don't expose that `.env` file anywhere.

  - Where real money is involved use the `--interactive` option or a [keystore file protected by a password](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu?tab=readme-ov-file#foundry-fundamentals-section-1-foundry-simple-storage).

There's one more thing about storing keys in a `.env` file. Please take a look at the ["THE .ENV PLEDGE"](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu/discussions/5). Read it, understand it and comment `I WILL BE SAFE`. Tweet it, Tiktok it, blog about it, make an Insta story about it, print it and put it on your fridge and share some copies with your neighbors. Please stay safe!

# Never use a .env file

Meanwhile, some things have changed

In our previous lesson, we showed you how to configure and use a `.env` file to hold your private key and rpc url, some developments have taken place since that lesson was made so ... You should never use a `.env` again.

## Encrypting your Keys Using ERC2335

For now, let's pretend our private key is this:

0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 (key 0 from Anvil)

Type the following command in your terminal:

```solidity
cast wallet import nameOfAccountGoesHere --interactive
```

Ideally, you don't do this in your VS Code.

You will be asked for your private key and a password to secure it. You will do this only once, which is amazing!

If you remember, last lesson we deployed running the following command:

```solidity
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Now that we configured our wallet we can deploy as following:

```solidity
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --account nameOfAccountGoesHere --sender 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266
```

You will be asked for your password. You won't be able to deploy without your password.

To see all the configured wallets you can call the following: cast wallet list.

Clear your history so your private key won't randomly remain there using the following command: history -c.

Stay safe! Stay froggy! Don't lose your keys. If you are seeing your private key in plain text, you are doing something wrong.
