# Foundry Fundamentals

Welcome to Foundry 101. Throughout this course, you will acquire the skills youâ€™ll need to start developing your smart contracts and protocols using the best web3 development tools and frameworks like Chainlink, Alchemy, and Foundry.

### What is Foundry?

Foundry is a relatively new but rapidly growing smart contract development framework known for its efficiency and modularity. The best short description of this powerful tool can be found in the [Foundry Book:](https://getfoundry.sh/)

```
Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.

```

Please take a moment to bookmark the [Foundry Book:](https://getfoundry.sh/). It is the most comprehensive resource that has the answers to all your questions. It will be handy along the way.

Foundry has numerous pros, such as:

- It leverages Rust for compilation, offering significantly faster build times compared to frameworks like Hardhat or Brownie.

- It's entirely Solidity-based, eliminating the need to learn other programming languages

- Its documentation is comprehensive.

### Our favorite code editor: Visual Studio Code

Throughout this course, we will use Visual Studio Code to write, test, deploy and interact with our smart contracts. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, powerful source code editor available on Windows, macOS and Linux. It has a comprehensive ecosystem of extensions that makes it one of the best choices when it comes to smart contract development.

### Keeping your Terminal Clutter-free

When commands pile up in your terminal, things can get a little overwhelming. Clear it up by simply typing `clear` and hitting `Enter`. Alternatively, use `Command K` if you're on a Mac or `Control K` if you're on Linux or Windows.

Pro tip: This is one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts that I use all the time.

### Understanding the Trash Can and the X

The trash can and the X buttons in your terminal perform distinct functions. Hitting X simply hides your terminal but retains all the previous lines of code. On the other hand, trashing it essentially deletes whatever is running in it. To open up a clean terminal, hit the trash can and then pull it back using `Control+`` or `Terminal > New Terminal`.

### Installing Foundry

With our terminal set and some tips up our sleeve, let's progress to installing Foundry. Navigate to the [Foundry website](https://getfoundry.sh/introduction/installation/) and from the installation tab, fetch the command to install Foundry.

The command would look something like this:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Hit `Enter` after pasting this in your terminal.

Note: You must have Internet access for this to work as it's downloading Foundry from their official website.

### Verifying Your Installation
After running the `curl` command, an output will appear at the bottom of your terminal indicating the detected shell and the fact that Foundry has been added to your Path.

For instance, the output can be something like this:

```bash
Detected your preferred shell is bashrc and added Foundry to Path run:source /home/user/.bashrcStart
a new terminal session to use Foundry
```

Now, simply type `foundryup` and `Enter` to install and update Foundry to the latest version. Whenever you want to install an update for Foundry, simply run `foundryup` again.

This will install four components: forge, cast, anvil, and chisel. To confirm the successful installation, run `forge --version`. You should get an output indicating the Forge version as shown below.

```bash
Forge version x.x.x
```

### Is Foundry Up Not Running?
Don't panic if this command doesn't run. You might have an issue with your path, and you might need to add Foundry to your path. In case you run into this issue, check lesson 6 of the GitHub repo associated with this course. If no debugging tips are available there, feel free to start a discussion on the course's GitHub repo. Before doing so, make sure to check if a similar discussion already exists.

Try typing `forge --version` into your terminal. Have you received an unwelcome output saying `Forge command found?` This implies that you have to rerun the `source` command that Foundry offered during installation.

Note: Most of the time the `bashrc` file gets loaded automatically. However, if this doesn't apply to your setup, the following lines can add the required command to the end of your `Bash profile`. This will ensure that your `bashrc` file loads by default.

```bash
cd ~
echo 'source /home/user/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

> this depends on your operating system, please check foundry docs to see detailed instructions.

# Quiz 7

**1. What is the main purpose of using a version control system like Git in your projects?**
* *a) To automatically fix bugs in the codebase.*
* *b) To optimize the performance of the final application.*
* *c) To design the visual layout of a user interface*
* *d) To track and manage changes to files, especially source code, over time.*

**2. When setting up credentials in some command-line interfaces, typed passwords may not be visually displayed. What is the typical reason for this behavior?**
* *a) It shows that the password has been automatically generated by the system.*
* *b) It indicates that the system does not actually require a password.*
* *c) It's a security measure to prevent ('shoulder surfing') from seeing the password as it's typed.*
* *d) It means the keyboard has temporarily stopped working correctly.*

**3. When working within a third-party cloud development platform, what practice is crucial regarding sensitive credentials?**
* *a) Assume the environment is as secure as your local machine for all data.*
* *b) Use only test or non-production credentials with no real-world value.*
* *c) Store credentials directly within the source code for easy access.*
* *d) Share credentials with team members via the platform's chat feature.*
