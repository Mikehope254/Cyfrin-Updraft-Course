In this section, we'll refer to the `FundMe` contract we built in the previous section. Additionally, we will explore storage using the [FunWithStorage](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu/blob/main/src/exampleContracts/FunWithStorage.sol) contract and interact with it using `cast`.

We'll also learn professional deployment techniques on different chains with Foundry [scripts](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu/blob/main/script/DeployFundMe.s.sol). They will enable us to interact with contracts through **reproducible actions** instead of typing commands manually each time.

Furthermore, we'll cover making contracts more gas-efficient, some debugging techniques, and setting up a professional development environment.
Lastly, we'll implement a lot of tests to ensure the reliability and security of our smart contracts.
