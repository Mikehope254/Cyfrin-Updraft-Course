# Introduction

In this section, we'll refer to the `FundMe` contract we built in the previous section. Additionally, we will explore storage using the [FunWithStorage](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu/blob/main/src/exampleContracts/FunWithStorage.sol) contract and interact with it using `cast`.

We'll also learn professional deployment techniques on different chains with Foundry [scripts](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu/blob/main/script/DeployFundMe.s.sol). They will enable us to interact with contracts through **reproducible actions** instead of typing commands manually each time.

Furthermore, we'll cover making contracts more gas-efficient, some debugging techniques, and setting up a professional development environment.
Lastly, we'll implement a lot of tests to ensure the reliability and security of our smart contracts.

# FundMe Project Setup

Here we'll cover Fund Me, a simple funding contract.

You will learn:

   - How to push your project to GitHub

   - Write and run amazing tests

   - Advanced deploy scripts, used to deploy on different chains that require different addresses

   - How to use scripts to interact with contracts, so we can easily reproduce our actions

   - How to use a price feed

   - How to use Chisel

   - Smart contract automation

   - How to make our contracts more gas efficient

   - And many more interesting things!

Until now, we talked a lot about storage and state, but we didn't delve into what they really mean. We will learn what all these means!

We used this project before when we used Remix.

## Fund Me

Going through the [repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-f23) we can see that our contract is in the src folder. Let's open `FundMe.sol`.

As you can see we are employing some advanced tools/standard naming conventions:

   - We use a named error `FundMe__NotOwner()`;

   - We use all caps for constants

   - `i_` for immutable variables

   - `s_` for private variables

Let's clone this project locally. Open your VS Code, and make sure you are in the `foundry-f23` folder, if not use `cd` to navigate to it.

If we run the `ls` command in the terminal, we'll see that the only thing present in the `foundry-f23` folder is the `foundry-simple-storage-f23` folder that we used in the previous section.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir foundry-fund-me-f23
cd foundry-fund-me-f23
code .
```

The first line creates a new folder called `foundry-fund-me-f23`. The second line changed the directory into the newly created folder. The last line opens up a new VS Code instance using the newly created folder.

Now we can apply the knowledge we acquired in the previous section to create a fresh Foundry project.

### Do you remember how?

If you do, please proceed in creating a Foundry project on your own. If not peek down below.

No worries, we all forget stuff, please run the following command:

```bash
forge init
```

or

```bash
forge init --force
```

Foundry will populate the project with the `Counter` files, the script, the main contract and the test.

Before deleting it, let's look a bit through these.

# Introduction to Smart Contract Testing

### Counter.sol

It's a simple smart contract that stores a number. You have a function to `setNumber` where you specify a `newNumber` which is a `uint256`, and store it, and you have a function to `increment` the number.

Note: `number++` is equivalent to `number = number + 1`.

### Counter.s.sol

Just a placeholder, it doesn't do anything

### Counter.t.sol

This is the interesting part. We haven't talked that much about carrying tests using Foundry. This is an essential step for any project. The `test` folder will become our new home throughout this course.

Please run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
forge test
```

After the contracts are compiled you will see an output related to tests:

   - How many tests were found;

   - In which file;

   - Did they pass or not?;

   - Summary;

## How does `forge test` work?

`forge test` has a lot of options that allow you to configure what is tested, how the results are displayed, where is the test conducted and many more!

Run `forge test --help` to explore the options. I suggest reading [this page](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests) and navigating deeper into the Foundry Book to discover how tests work.

But in short, in our specific case:

   1. Forge identified all the files in the test folder, went into the only file available and ran the `setUp` function.

   2. After the setup is performed it goes from top to bottom in search of public/external functions that start with `test`.

   3. All of them will be called and the conclusion of their execution will be displayed. By that we mean it will run all the `assert` statements it can find and if all evaluate to `true` then the test will pass. If one of the `assert` statements evaluates to `false` the test will fail.

# Finishing the Setup

Please delete the `Counter` files that Foundry prepopulated in our new project.

In `src` create two files, `FundMe.sol` and `PriceConverter.sol`.

Go on the [Remix Fund Me repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-fund-me-f23) and copy the contents of both contracts.

Try running `forge compile` or `forge build`. A few errors will pop up. What's the problem?

If you open both the copied smart contracts you will see that up top we `import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";`. This wasn't a problem in Remix because Remix automatically takes care of this problem for you. In Foundry you have to manually install all your dependencies.

`forge install` is the command we are using to install one or multiple dependencies. [Go here](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/install#forge-install) to read more about this command.

Call the following:

```bash
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@ 
```

Wait for it to finish.

We used `forge install` to ask Forge to install something in our project. What? We specified the path to a GitHub repository, this also could have been a raw URL. What version? Following the path to a GitHub repository you can add an `@` and then you can specify:

   - A branch: master

   - A tag: v1.2.3.4 or 0.6.1 in our case

   - A commit: 8e8128

> Newer Foundry versions donâ€™t auto-commit hence do not require "--no-commit"

If we open the `lib` folder, we can see the `forge-std` which is installed automatically within the `forge init` setup and `chainlink-brownie-contracts` which we just installed. Look through the former, you'll see a folder called contracts then a folder called `src`. Here you can find different versions, and inside them, you can find a plethora of contracts, some of which we are going to use in this course. Here we can find the `AggregatorV3Interface` that we are importing in `FundMe.sol`.

But if you open the `FundMe.sol` you'll see that we are importing `{AggregatorV3Interface}` from `"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";` not from `/foundry-fund-me-f23/lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol`. How does Foundry know `@chainlink` to half of the path?

Open `foundry.toml`. Below the last line of `[profile.default]` paste the following:

```toml
remappings = ['@chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']
```

Now Forge knows to equivalate these. Let's try to compile now by calling `forge compile` or `forge build`.

Awesome! Everything complies.

Fixing dependencies in projects is one of the most undesirable things in smart contracts development/audit. Take it slow, make sure you select the proper GitHub repository path, make sure your remappings are solid and they match your imports and everything will be fine!
